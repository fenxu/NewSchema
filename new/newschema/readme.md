# ReadMe on  Microsoft Azure DocumentDB 

This article provides an introduction to Microsoft Azure DocumentDB, a fully-managed NoSQL document database service for developers, IT Pros, and business decision makers. 

A quick way to learn about DocumentDB and see it in action is to follow these three steps: 

1. Watch the two minute [What is DocumentDB?](http://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/videos/what-is-azure-documentdb/) video, which introduces the benefits of using DocumentDB.
2. Watch the three minute [Create DocumentDB on Azure](http://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/videos/create-documentdb-on-azure/) video, which highlights how to get started with DocumentDB by using the Azure preview portal.
3. Visit the [Query Playground](http://www.documentdb.com/sql/demo), where you can walk through different activities to learn about the rich querying functionality available in DocumentDB. Then, head over to the Sandbox tab and run your own custom SQL queries and experiment with DocumentDB.
