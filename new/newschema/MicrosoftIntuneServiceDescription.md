## Service Description
Intune is a cloud-based service that helps you manage Windows PCs, and iOS, Android, and Windows mobile devices. Intune also helps protect corporate applications and data. You can use Intune alone or you can integrate it with System Center 2012 R2 Configuration Manager to extend your management capabilities.

Microsoft offers the Intune Onboarding benefit for eligible services in eligible plans. The Onboarding benefit lets you work remotely with Microsoft specialists to get your Intune environment ready for use. For more information, see [Microsoft Intune Onboarding Benefit Description](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=619281).

You can start using Intune with a 30-day free trial that includes 100 user licenses. To start your free trial, [click here to visit the Intune Sign up page](http://aka.ms/TryMSIntune). If your organization has an Enterprise Agreement or equivalent volume licensing agreement, please contact your Microsoft representative to set up your free trial.

> If your organization has a Microsoft Online Services work or school account, and you might continue with this Intune subscription in production after the trial period ends, then you should click the **Sign in** option on that page and authenticate by using the Global Administrator account for your organization. This action will ensure that your Intune trial links to your existing work or school account.

## <a name="WIT_Cho"></a>Choose the management solution that’s right for you
You can configure Intune in a number of ways to manage and help protect your company's mobile devices and computers (referred to as **devices** in this document).


- **Intune stand-alone configuration.** Use the web-based administration console in Intune to manage devices in your organization. Intune can be used without any on-premises IT infrastructure, but if you use Intune with Active Directory Domain Services, you can use domain user accounts that you manage with Domain Services with Intune.
- **Intune with System Center Configuration Manager.** Use the System Center 2012 Configuration Managermanagement console to manage computers and mobile devices in your enterprise. This configuration can help you to manage all of your organization’s devices through a single console, the Configuration Manager Admin Console. Configuration Manager supports very large numbers of mobile devices, servers and computers. For more information, see [How to Manage Mobile Devices by Using Configuration Manager and Microsoft Intune](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=271118) in the [Documentation Library for System Center 2012 Configuration Manager](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/33b7b516-2d32-4e55-bd79-ed7d3ea37162).
