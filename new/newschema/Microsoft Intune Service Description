## <a name="WIT_Cho"></a>Choose the management solution that’s right for you
You can configure [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](/Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] in a number of ways to manage and help protect your company's mobile devices and computers (referred to as **devices** in this document).


- **[!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](/Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] stand-alone configuration.** Use the web-based administration console in [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](/Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] to manage devices in your organization. [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](/Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] can be used without any on-premises IT infrastructure, but if you use [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](/Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] with Active Directory Domain Services, you can use domain user accounts that you manage with Domain Services with [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](/Token/wit_nextref_md.md)].
- **[!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](/Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] with System Center Configuration Manager.** Use the [!INCLUDE[cm5short](/Token/cm5short_md.md)] management console to manage computers and mobile devices in your enterprise.
